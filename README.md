### Discord MPRIS Integration - Work In Progress

```
git clone https://github.com/QaidVoid/mpriscord.git
make
./build/mpriscord
```

Media player priority can be changed in `include/mpris.h`.

Supported media players:
- [CMUS](https://cmus.github.io)
- [Plasma Browser Integration](https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Browser_Integration) for Firefox
- [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc)
Other media players implementing MPRIS interface should also work.
